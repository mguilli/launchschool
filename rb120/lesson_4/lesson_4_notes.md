**Object#instance_variables** can be used to return all instance variables of an object.
Note that only initialized instance variables are returned
Note that defining an accessor method does not create the corresponding instance variable

**Object#instance_variable_get** can be used to access instance variables without a public interface
Not recommended for general use
