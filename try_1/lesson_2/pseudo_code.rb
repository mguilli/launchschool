# Pseudo Code Practice

# 1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
Given two integers
add number1 to number2 and return the result

START
# Given two integers called "number1" and "number2"
number1 + number2
END

# 2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
START
# Given an array of strings called "words"
ITERATE over words
  SET result += each word
RETURN result
END

# 3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
START
# Given an array of integers called "numbers"
SET result_array = []
ITERATE over numbers with index
  IF index is even
    push value to result_array
RETURN result_array
END
