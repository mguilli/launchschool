The following code:
```ruby
array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)
array2 = []
array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
puts array2
```
will output:
```
Moe
Larry
CURLY
SHEMP
Harpo
CHICO
Groucho
Zeppo
```
The key to understanding this output is the line: 
```ruby
array1.each { |value| array2 << value }`
```
During the iteration over `array1`, `value` is being pushed to `array2`. `value` is,in fact, just a reference that points to a string in memory. So, at the end of the iteration, `array2` holds a collection of references pointing to the same strings as the references in array1.

If you were to look at the object_id's of each array, you would see they are identical.
```ruby
[7] pry(main)> array1.map {|x| x.object_id}
=> [70115458792620,
 70115458792600,
 70115458792580,
 70115458792560,
 70115458792540,
 70115458792520,
 70115458792500,
 70115458792480]
[8] pry(main)> array2.map {|x| x.object_id}
=> [70115458792620,
 70115458792600,
 70115458792580,
 70115458792560,
 70115458792540,
 70115458792520,
 70115458792500,
 70115458792480]
 ```
So when the program iterates the second time:
```ruby
array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
```
`upcase!` is mutating the string in memory that the references in `array1` point to. Since the references in `array2` also point to the exact same strings, the changes made when iterating through `array1` appear when printing the values in `array2`
