The code:

```ruby
name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name
```
will print out:

```ruby
BOB
BOB
```

The reason for this is that when `save_name = name` was processed, `save_name`
and `name` were set to point to the same space in memory, containing the string
'Bob'. When `upcase!` was invoked on the `name` variable, the string 'Bob' at 
that space in memory was mutated in place to 'BOB'. Since both variables point
at the same space in memory, both variables print out the same value.
