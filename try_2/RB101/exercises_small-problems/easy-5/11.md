Given the following code:

```ruby
def spin_me(str)
  str.split.each do |word|
    word.reverse!
  end.join(" ")
end

spin_me("hello world") # "olleh dlrow"
```

Will the returned string be the same object as the one passed in as an argument?

No. When `str.split` is invoked, the result is a new array of substrings. Both the array and each substring have new and independent object_ids. So, when `word.reverse!` is called, it is mutating each substring in the array, but neither the array nor the substrings have any connection to the original string object anymore.
