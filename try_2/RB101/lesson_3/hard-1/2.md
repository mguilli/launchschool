```ruby
greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings
```

It will print { :a => 'hi there' }. Although `informal_greeting` was the variable being mutated, it pointed to the same string in memory as 
`greetings[:a]`.
