```ruby
puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)
```

Results in an error because 40+2 resolves to an Integer object, and Ruby does not automatically convert integers to string objects when String#+ is invoked.

The error can be done by calling Integer#to_s on the resulting integer, or by using `#{}` style string interpolation.
