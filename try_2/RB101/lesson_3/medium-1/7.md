The code:
```ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

def mess_with_demographics(demo_hash)
  demo_hash.values.each do |family_member|
    family_member["age"] += 42
    family_member["gender"] = "other"
  end
end

mess_with_demographics(munsters)
```

When run, wrecked the demographics. The `family_member` variable points to each nested hash used in the key/value pair in `munsters`. When age and gender were reassigned, the pointer to the nested hash was unchanged, but the values inside that nested hash were altered.
